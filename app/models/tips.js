		["i before e, except after c or when sounded like 'ay' as in neighbor and weigh"],
		["'Silent e helps a vowel say its name.' This means that when a word ends with a vowel followed by a consonant and then silent e, the vowel has a long sound. That's the difference between rate and rat, hide and hid, and cube and cub."],
		["Have you heard the expression 'When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking?' This means that when there are two vowels in a row, the first usually has a long sound and the second is silent. That's why it's team, not taem; coat, not caot; and wait, not wiat. Remembering this rule will help you to put vowels in the right order."],
		["Its' helpful to try making up a funny memory aids. For example, do you have trouble remembering which has two s's-desert (arid land) or dessert (a sweet treat)? Remember that with dessert, you'd like seconds. Similarly, do you have trouble remembering how to spell separate? Remember that there's a rat in the middle."],
		["Make sure that you are pronouncing words correctly. This can help you to avoid some common spelling errors, such as canidate instead of candidate, jewelery instead of jewelry, and libary instead of library."],
		["Put together a list of words that you find difficult to spell. Go over your old papers and spelling exams to track down these troublemakers. Once you've got your list in hand, see if some of the tips above will help you."],
		["Certain English nouns change a vowel sound when they become plural. These include goose, geese; man, men; mouse, mice; and tooth, teeth."],
		["Some nouns don't change at all when they become plural. These include deer, fish, sheep, and species."],
		["A few nouns have plural forms that are left from Old English. These include child, children and ox, oxen."],
		["Don't use an apostrophe to form a plural. A sentence like 'Please keep the gate's clear' is wrong. Use an apostrophe to indicate possession, or to show that a word has been contracted."],
		["Use like before a noun, as in 'She's very like her mother'. Where a clause follows, you should use as or as if, e.g. 'He's behaving as if he owns the place' (not 'like he owns'), or 'You don't know him as I do' (not 'like I do')."],
		["You're is a contraction of 'You are'. The possessive is your. Say `You're my best friend', but `Where is your friend?'"],
		["It's is the contracted form of 'It is' or 'It has', not the possessive of it. The possessive is its, with no apostrophe. So you should say `It's a lovely day' or `It's been a lovely day', but `The dog is in its kennel'."],
		["It is wrong to say something like 'There wasn't hardly anyone there'; hardly and scarcely should not be used with negatives."],
		["The verb miss already has a negative meaning, and doesn't need to have a negative added: say `I miss seeing her', not `I miss not seeing her'."],
		["Occur and occurrence but refer and reference. In verbs ending in -ur and -ur, double the r when you add -ence; leave it single if the verb ends in -er or -ear (appear and apparent)."],
		["People often confuse unstressed e and a in words like category, desperate, separate, grammar. It is easy to muddle pairs such as allude and elude, affect and effect, which have very similar pronunciations."],
		["It's easy to confuse o with both a and e in unstressed syllables. Words which you may find difficult include corroborate (not -erate) and propaganda (not propo-)."],
		
		["Do not confuse adoptive with adopted: children are adopted, but parents are adoptive."],
		["Do not confuse adverse, 'unfavourable, bad', with averse, which means 'strongly disliking or opposed to', as in I am not averse to helping out."],
		["Do not confuse affect and effect: affect means 'make a difference to', whereas effect means 'a result' or 'bring about (a result)'."],
		["Do not confuse ambiguous with ambivalent: ambiguous primarily means 'having more than one meaning, open to different interpretations', while ambivalent means 'having mixed feelings'."],
		["Do not confuse amoral with immoral: amoral means 'not concerned with morality', while immoral means 'not conforming to accepted standards of morality'."],
		["Do not confuse appraise with apprise: appraise means 'assess', while apprise means 'inform'."],
		["Do not confuse augur, 'be a sign of (a likely outcome)', with auger (a tool used for boring)."],
		["Do not confuse censure with censor: censure means 'express strong disapproval of', whereas censor means 'suppress unacceptable parts of (a book, film, etc.)'."],
		["Do not confuse climactic, 'forming a climax', with climatic, which means 'relating to climate'."],
		["Do not confuse complacent, 'smug and self-satisfied', with complaisant, which means 'willing to please'."],
		["Do not confuse complement, 'a thing that enhances something by contributing extra features', with compliment, which means 'an expression of praise' or 'politely congratulate'."],
		["Do not confuse continuous and continual: continuous primarily means 'without interruption', and can refer to space as well as time, as in the cliffs form a continuous line along the coast; continual, on the other hand, typically means 'happening frequently, with intervals between', as in the bus service has been disrupted by continual breakdowns."],
		["Do not confuse council, an administrative or advisory body, with counsel, advice or guidance."],
		["Do not confuse councillor with counsellor: a councillor is a member of a council, whereas a counsellor is someone who gives guidance on personal or psychological problems."],
		["Do not confuse credible with creditable: credible means 'believable, convincing', whereas creditable means 'deserving acknowledgement and praise'."],
		["Do not confuse definite ('certain, sure') with definitive, which means 'decisive and with authority'."],
		["Do not confuse defuse, 'remove the fuse from (an explosive device)' or 'reduce the danger or tension in (a difficult situation)', with diffuse, which means 'spread over a wide area'."],
		["Do not confuse desert (a waterless area) with dessert (the sweet course)!"],
		["Do not confuse discreet, 'careful not to attract attention or give offence', with discrete, which means 'separate, distinct'."],
		["Do not confuse draft and draught. In British English draft means 'a preliminary version' or 'an order to pay a sum', whereas a draught is a current of air or an act of drinking; in North American English the spelling draft is used for all senses. The verb is usually spelled draft."],
		["Do not confuse draw, which is primarily a verb, with drawer meaning 'sliding storage compartment'."],
		["Do not confuse egoism and egotism: it is egotism, not egoism, that means 'excessive conceit or self-absorption'; egoism is a less common and more technical word, for an ethical theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of morality."],
		["Do not confuse envelop with envelope: envelop without an e at the end means 'wrap up, cover, or surround completely', whereas an envelope with an e is a paper container used to enclose a letter or document."],
		["Do not confuse exceptionable ('open to objection; causing disapproval or offence') with exceptional ('not typical' or 'unusually good')."],
		["Do not confuse flaunt with flout; flaunt means 'display ostentatiously', while flout means 'openly disregard (a rule)'."],
		["Do not confuse forego and forgo: forego means 'precede', but is also a less common spelling for forgo, 'go without'."],
		["Do not confuse grisly with grizzly, as in grizzly bear: grisly means 'causing horror or revulsion', whereas grizzly is from the same root as grizzled and refers to the bear's white-tipped fur."],
		["Do not confuse hoard with horde: a hoard is a store of something valuable; horde is a disparaging term for a large group of people."],
		["Do not confuse loath ('reluctant; unwilling') with loathe, 'dislike greatly'."],
		["Do not confuse loose with lose: as a verb loose means 'unfasten or set free', while lose means 'cease to have' or 'become unable to find'."],
		["Do not confuse militate, which is used in the form militate against to mean 'be an important factor in preventing', with mitigate, which means 'make (something bad) less severe'."],
		["Do not confuse officious, 'asserting authority or interfering in an annoyingly domineering way', with official, which means 'relating to an authority or public body' and 'having the approval or authorization of such a body'."],
		["Do not confuse ordinance, 'an authoritative order', with ordnance, which means 'guns' or 'munitions'."],
		["Do not confuse palate and palette: the palate is the roof of the mouth; a palette, on the other hand, is an artist's board for mixing colours."],
		["Do not confuse pedal and peddle. Pedal is a noun denoting a foot-operated lever; as a verb it means 'move by means of pedals'. Peddle is a verb meaning 'sell (goods)'. The associated noun from pedal is pedaller (US pedaler), and the noun from peddle is pedlar or peddler."],
		["Do not confuse principal, 'first in order of importance; main', with principle, which is a noun meaning chiefly 'a basis of a system of thought or belief'."],
		["Do not confuse proscribe with prescribe: proscribe is a rather formal word meaning 'condemn or forbid', whereas prescribe means either 'issue a medical prescription' or 'recommend with authority'."],
		["Do not confuse regretful, 'feeling or showing regret', with regrettable, which means 'giving rise to regret; undesirable'."],
		["Do not confuse stationary and stationery: stationary is an adjective with the sense 'not moving or changing', whereas stationery is a noun meaning 'paper and other writing materials'."],
		["Do not confuse unexceptionable, 'that cannot be taken exception to, inoffensive', with unexceptional, 'not exceptional; ordinary'."],
		["Do not confuse who's with whose; who's is a contraction of who is or who has, while whose is used in questions such as whose is this? and whose turn is it?"],
		["Do not confuse wreath and wreathe: wreath with no e at the end means 'arrangement of flowers', while wreathe with an e is a verb meaning 'envelop, surround, or encircle'."],
		["Do not confuse your with you're; you're is a contraction of you are, while your is a possessive determiner used in phrases such as your turn."]
