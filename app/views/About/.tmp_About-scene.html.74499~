    <div class="palm-body-text">When you start the game it will list out 4 choices of a word,
	only one of the choices is truly correct.<br/><br/>
	When you select a choice the game will subtly indicate whether or not it is the correct choice.  
	If you make all of the correct choices in the level of 5 words, you progress.  
	If you guess incorrectly the game will start the current level over.<br/><br/>
	A constant timer is ticking down your score for a level so be quick!<br/><br/>
	I hope to add more levels over time!  Good luck!</div>
