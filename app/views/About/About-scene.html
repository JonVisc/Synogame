    	The game will start with a choice of four buttons.  Three of the buttons contain synonyms of each other.  Only one of the buttons is an antonym of all three others (to the best of its ability).  Pick the antonym and the game progresses, if you pick the wrong word within five choices the level resets and you have to pick the correct antonym of five words again!<br/>
		Get five right in a row and the game progresses!  There are spelling tips and fun facts at the end of each level recap!  Good luck!  I hope to add more levels over time.<br/><br/>
